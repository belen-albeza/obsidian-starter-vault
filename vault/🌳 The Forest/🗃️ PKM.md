# üóÉÔ∏è PKM

**Personal Knowledge Management** (or PKM) is a process an individual uses to **collect** and **classify** information and ideas.

Some important concepts are:

- [[Evergreen notes are always evolving]]
- [[Maps of contents]]
- [[PKM systems should be future-proof]]
- [[A digital garden is a non-linear collection of notes]]

PKM is related to [[Learning]] and [[Productivity]].

## Resources, tools, people, etc.
