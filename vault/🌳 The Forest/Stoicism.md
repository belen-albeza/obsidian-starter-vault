# Stoicism

Stoicism is a school of [[Philosophy]] that appeared circa 300 BC.

- Accepting the present moment as it is.
- Not being controlled by desires of fears.
- Working on fulfilling one's life purpose.
- Collaborating with others and treating them fairly.

Notable stoics include:

- [[Marcus Aurelius]], a Roman emperor.
- [[Epictetus]], a philosopher and former slave.
- [[Seneca]], a dramatist and philosopher.
