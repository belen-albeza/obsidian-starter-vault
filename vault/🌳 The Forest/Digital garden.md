# Digital garden

==A digital garden is a collection of notes== that is:

- **Explorable in a non-linear way**. [[Notes should be densely linked]], building connections among them.
- **Grown over time**. The core part of a garden are [[Evergreen notes]].

The purpose of a garden is to **accumulate knowledge over time**.

Gardens can be public (see [[List of digital gardeners]]) or private. **Public gardens** usually take the form of online websites that differ from the current trend of having content organized by date.
