[[🗃️ PKM]]

# Evergreen notes

Evergreen notes are a [[🗃️ PKM]] concept. It refers to notes that are **continuously evolving and accumulating value** over time.

- Evergreen notes are [[Atomic notes|concept-oriented, atomic notes]].
- Evergreen notes are [[Notes should be densely linked|densely linked]].
- Evergreen notes are [[We should write notes with our own words|written with our own words]].
- Evergreen notes are [[Note-making vs note-taking|made, not taken]].

Some of the advantages of this type of notes include:
- Easy retrieval, since they are about a single concept.
- Enabling forming new ideas and find connections by serendipity, since they are densely linked.

I first learned of this concept from [Andy's Working Notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes).
