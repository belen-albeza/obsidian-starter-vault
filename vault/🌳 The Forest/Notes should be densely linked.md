[[Evergreen notes are always evolving]]

# Notes should be densely linked

In a [[PKM system]], we should favor notes that are **densely linked**, with references between them.

Why?

- When we link a note to another, we build a relationship between them. This help us both **navigate** our [[A digital garden is a non-linear collection of notes|Digital garden]] and create **new ideas**.
- We are reinforcing the presence of [[Atomic notes contain a single idea|Atomic notes]], because it's easier to link this way.
