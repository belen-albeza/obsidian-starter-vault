# ðŸª´ Tending this Garden

It's Garden, with capital `G`, because this is my [[A digital garden is a non-linear collection of notes|Digital garden]].

## Setup

See the [[Folder structure]] in place and the [[Tag taxonomy]].

Some [[Obsidian plugins|Plugins]] have been installed.

## How to

**Newly created notes** are automatically put within the `ðŸŒ± Seedbox` folder.

The **emoji** selector can be brought with `Cmd+;` (this shortcut can be changed in the `Hotkeys` section in the `Options` dialog).

To create a **daily journal note for today**, either click on the day in the calendar pane, or run the command `Daily notes: Open today's daily note` (open the command palette with `Ctrl/Cmd + P`).
