[[🪴 Tending this Garden]]

# Folder structure
Folders are meant to be big buckets of notes. [[🪴 Tending this Garden|🪴 This Garden]] has:

- `⚙️ Meta` for notes and tools to handle this Obsidian vault.
    - `📎 Attachments` contains all the file attachments
    - `📐 Templates` for Obsidian templates
- `🌱 Seedbox` for notes whose location is not yet clear, scratchpads, quick writedowns of ideas…
- `🌳 The Forest` for [[Evergreen notes]]. Most notes of the Garden live here.
- `🏝️ Spaces` for projects or other endeavors which need their own separate space/folder.
- `💧 Sources` for [[Literature notes]] on books, courses, videos…
