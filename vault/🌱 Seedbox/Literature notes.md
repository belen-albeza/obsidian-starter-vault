# Literature notes

This is a [[🗃️ PKM]] concept. ==Literature notes are notes that capture something we read==, watched or heard: a book, a course, a video…

These notes usually contain a summary and/or an outline, as well as our own commentary.

The **purpose** of these notes is to serve as reference, and to later extract and synthesize what we consider valuable in [[Evergreen notes]].
